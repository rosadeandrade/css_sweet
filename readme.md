Interface Design using CSS

Assignment Three

How Sweet Is This!

Description:

Using everything that we have covered over the course of the semester, create a web page about your favorite candy. Incorporate some interesting facts about the candy, some eye-popping imagery, and perhaps even some nutritional information.

Instructions:

Please read and follow the instructions below carefully:
1. Choose your favorite candy
2. Gather images and text about your candy. Please do not use filler text for the content of the web page.
3. The layout for the page should be created using a liquid approach. This does not mean that the layout needs to be full-width but if the page is not full-width the contents of the page should be aligned to the center of the browser.
4. The page should be constructed with the appropriate semantic HTML elements.
5. Create a separate CSS file to manage all the styling for the webpage.
6. Use a custom font that would be appropriate for the type of content that will be on the webpage.
7. Include some enhancements to the HTML elements, some ideas:
a. Gradient backgrounds
b. Multiple background images
c. A cool hover effect
d. Maybe even an SVG
8. Create a footer that contains a logo, company information, and a quick contact form (just the front end, the form does not need to work!).
9. Validate your HTML
10. Validate your CSS
